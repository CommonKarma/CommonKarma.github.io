<h1 id="what-if-the-web-had-a-trash-can">What if the web had a trash can?</h1>

<p>You click a link because it promises good things. Instead, you get garbage. Propoganda or paid advertising masquerading as journalism. Someone trying to sell you junk you don&rsquo;t need. A product review written by a shill. More viral nonsense. A stupid list of ten stupid things spread across ten pages so they can show you ten ads. A scam you know hurts many innocent people. Or something just poorly written or plain wrong.</p>

<p>All you can do is press the back button. Retreat.</p>

<p>(You were just had. And they made money from it anyway. This is how the web works today. Google, Facebook and many others are in on this too. They don&rsquo;t fix it because they make so much money from it.)</p>

<p>More junk from the same perp keeps reappearing in your search results, social media feeds, and regular browsing. You can&rsquo;t make it go away. You wish you could warn other people: <em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go there. Trust me. It&rsquo;s garbage.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>What if your browser had a <span class="garbage-can"><img src="garbage-can.svg" alt="a trash can" /></span> button? You press it and the page you&rsquo;re on is marked as garbage and thrown out. Your browser learns from each mark, automatically detecting and crossing out <del>links to other garbage</del>. Marks are shared across millions of users, and soon most garbage on the web is marked. You no longer have to wade through ten <del>bad things</del> to find one good one. Producers of <del>click bait</del>, <del>scams</del>, <del>false advertising</del>, <del>fake news</del> and <del>junk</del> are punished with lost traffic and dwindling profits. They go out of business, reducing web garbage ever further.</p>

<p>How can this work if people disagree on what is and isn&rsquo;t garbage? If we share marks only between people with similar standards of truth and utility, how do we avoid separating everyone into bubbles of conforming tastes and opinions? I believe I have a solution, and it does something incredible: It makes the web inherently <em>un-gameable</em>.</p>

<p>Imagine a web where dishonesty always backfires. Where what goes around <em>always</em> comes around. A web with accountability. A web with <strong>karma</strong>.</p>

<p>Healthy discourse would have a chance. Trust would trounce <del>lies</del>. Journalism would be journalism again.</p>

<p>If this sounds radically ambitious, it is. It has to be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m working on it. You can check back here, but it could be a while. Better to <a href="mailto:whatif@commonkarma.org">drop me a line</a>. Especially if you want to help.</p>
